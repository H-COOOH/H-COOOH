## Hi there 👋

<!--
**H-COOOH/H-COOOH** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently focusing on applying a PhD degree.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how society works.
- 💬 Ask me about anything you would like to know!
- 📫 How to reach me: `contact [at] mzxr.top`. Hey, I have a [PGP public key](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/AFA8649C01C4A94CA9A10FFCA5493399E151F124)!
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him. You can call me Yiting or Mzxr, I use the latter as my online account nickname most of the time!
- ⚡ Fun fact: [H-COOH](https://github.com/H-COOH) is the account I use for personal development, and [H-COOOH](https://github.com/H-COOOH) is the account I use for work. What's the difference? Work requires more oxygen :)
