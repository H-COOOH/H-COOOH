## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently focusing on applying a PhD degree.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how society works.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you would like to know!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: `contact [at] mzxr.top`. Hey, I have a [PGP public key](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/AFA8649C01C4A94CA9A10FFCA5493399E151F124)!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: `he/him`. You can call me `Yiting` or `Mzxr`, I use the latter as my online account nickname most of the time!
- âš¡ Fun fact: [H-COOH](https://github.com/H-COOH) is the account I use for personal development, and [H-COOOH](https://github.com/H-COOOH) is the account I use for work. What's the difference? Work requires more oxygen :)
